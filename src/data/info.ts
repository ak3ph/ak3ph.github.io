  about: `As a DevOps Engineer with 4+ years of experience, I specialize in optimizing CI/CD pipelines, implementing Infrastructure as Code (IaC), and architecting scalable cloud solutions. 
          My expertise spans a comprehensive DevOps tech stack, including AWS, containerization with Docker and Kubernetes, and automation tools like Ansible and Terraform. 
          I'm proficient in multiple programming languages including JavaScript and Python which I leverage for effective scripting and automation.   
          My experience includes managing CI/CD pipelines using Jenkins, GitLab CI, and AWS CodePipeline, as well as optimizing AWS resources for cost-effective cloud operations.
